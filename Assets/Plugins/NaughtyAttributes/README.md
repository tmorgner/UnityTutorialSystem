# NaughtyAttributes
NaughtyAttributes is an extension for the Unity Inspector.

It expands the range of attributes that Unity provides so that you can create powerful inspectors without the need of custom editors or property drawers. It also provides attributes that can be applied to non-serialized fields or functions.

It is implemented by replacing the default Unity Inspector. This means that if you have any custom editors, NaughtyAttributes will not work with them. All of your custom editors and property drawers are not affected in any way.

## System Requirements
Unity 2017.1.0 or later versions. Feel free to try older version. Don't forget to include the NaughtyAttributes namespace.

## Drawer Attributes
Provide special draw options to serialized fields.
A field can have only one DrawerAttribute. If a field has more than one, only the bottom one will be used.

### Slider
The same as Unity's **Range** attribute.
There is no difference between the two, you can use whatever you like, I just wanted to support a custom slider attribute.

### MinMaxSlider
A double slider. The **min value** is saved to the **X** property, and the **max value** is saved to the **Y** property of a **Vector2** field.

### ReorderableList
Provides array type fields with an interface for easy reordering of elements.

### Button
A method can be marked as a button. A button appears in the inspector and executes the method if clicked.
Works both with instance and static methods.

### Dropdown
Provides an interface for dropdown value selection.

### ResizableTextArea
A resizable text area where you can see the whole text.
Unlike Unity's **Multiline** and **TextArea** attributes where you can see only 3 rows of a given text, and in order to see it or modify it you have to manually scroll down to the desired row.

### ShowNonSerializedField
Shows non-serialized fields in the inspector.
All non-serialized fields are displayed at the botton of the inspector before the method buttons.
Keep in mind that if you change a non-static non-serialized field in the code - the value in the inspector will be updated after you press **Play** in the editor.
There is no such issue with static non-serialized fields because their values are updated at compile time.
It supports only certain types **(bool, int, long, float, double, string, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Color, Bounds, Rect, UnityEngine.Object)**.

### ShowNativeProperty
Shows native C# properties in the inspector.
All native properties are displayed at the bottom of the inspector after the non-serialized fields and before the method buttons.
It supports only certain types **(bool, int, long, float, double, string, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Color, Bounds, Rect, UnityEngine.Object)**.

## DrawCondition Attributes
Can be used to specify when a given serialized field is visible, and when not. A field can have only one DrawConditionAttribute.

### ShowIf / HideIf

## Group Attributes
Serialized fields can be grouped in different groups.
A field can have only one GroupAttribute. If a field has more than one, only the bottom one will be used.

### BoxGroup
Surrounds grouped fields with a box.

## Validator Attributes
Used for validating the fields. A field can have infinite number of validator attributes.

### MinValue / MaxValue
Clamps integer and float fields.

### Required

### ValidateInput
The most powerful ValidatorAttribute.

## Meta Attributes
Give the fields meta data. A field can have infinite number of meta attributes.

### InfoBox
Used for providing additional information.

![code](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes/blob/master/Assets/Plugins/NaughtyAttributes/Documentation/InfoBox_Code.PNG)

![inspector](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes/blob/master/Assets/Plugins/NaughtyAttributes/Documentation/InfoBox_Inspector.PNG)

### OnValueChanged
Detects a value change and executes a callback.
Keep in mind that the event is detected only when the value is changed from the inspector.
If you want a runtime event, you should probably use an event/delegate and subscribe to it.

![code](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes/blob/master/Assets/Plugins/NaughtyAttributes/Documentation/OnValueChanged_Code.PNG)

## How to create your own attributes
Lets say you want to implement your own **[ReadOnly]** attribute.

First you have to create a **ReadOnlyAttribute** class
```
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Field, AllowMultiple = false, Inherited = true)]
public class ReadOnlyAttribute : DrawerAttribute
{
}
```

Then you need to create a drawer for that attribute
```
[PropertyDrawer(typeof(ReadOnlyAttribute))]
public class ReadOnlyPropertyDrawer : PropertyDrawer
{
	public override void DrawProperty(SerializedProperty property)
	{
		GUI.enabled = false;
		EditorGUILayout.PropertyField(property, true);
		GUI.enabled = true;
	}
}
```

Last, in order for the editor to recognize the drawer for this attribute, you have to press the **Tools/NaughtyAttributes/Update Attributes Database** menu item in the editor.
